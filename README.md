This is a freelance project for IN-NEXT. The example files: GenDetached, GenEnveloped were provided by the company, with just the basic code. 
I updated the code to my own understanding, to get the desired resoults. 
Requirement was to digitally sighn an xml document using SHA1 algorithm (even though it is not the most secure algorithm that is available). 
This project was used in a software for the company, but since It was rewritten in C#, I've got permission to share the Java example.
